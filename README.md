============

To get things started clone down the repository. 

* Run npm install to get your dependencies.

* Next run npm start to crank up the server. 

* Finally visit localhost:3000 to test out the functionality. 

> Directions are listed on the homepage of the app, but I'll mention them here as well. 

Accessing App: 

You start the application with a default access pin of `1234`, and a starting balance of `0`. You may choose to change the pin
what ever you like or use `1234`. Either way you will not be able to perform any transactional commands without submitting the 
correct access pin. Although you will be able to view the balance at anytime without entering a pin.

Transactional Details: 

The withdraw/deposit fields expect for you to enter valid integers. With that being said, if letters and/or non numbers are submitted
to the form, the value of the current balance will not change for the given input field. 

If you have any questions about how anything works, don't hesitate to reach out!
